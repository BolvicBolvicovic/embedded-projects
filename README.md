# Embedded projects

Here you will find all my embedded projects.

## Usage

To compile, upload and watch the serial, you need the arduino-cli toolchain or the arduino IDE. I use the former.
You might also need to download specific librairies related to the project (i.e. the dht11 uses the dht11 librairy version 2.1.0), and the toolchain for the nodemcu esp8266. I won't go into details here, you can easily find all informations needed online.<br/>
Once you got there, go to the project you want to try and run `make`. Note that you might need to run `make attach`before. Note that I have not tested this setup on Windows.

## Schemas

I have uploaded the schema as a picture for each project. They are in their respective folder.
